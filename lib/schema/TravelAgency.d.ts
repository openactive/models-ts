 * Runtime validator for schema:TravelAgency.
 *
 * If some data has a structure which matches a schema:TravelAgency, it will be returned with the correct type.
 * Otherwise, this function returns an OAValidationError with details about why the data does not match.
 *
 * Use this to e.g. check a JSON object received in an HTTP request. Example usage (for an express request handler):
 *
 * ```ts
 * const maybeTravelAgency = validateTravelAgency(req.body); // `req.body` will have type `any` or `unknown`
 * if (maybeTravelAgency instanceof OaValidationError) {
 *   // From this point on, `maybeTravelAgency` will have type `OaValidationError`
 *   const error = maybeTravelAgency;
 *   // Do something with the error. Maybe ignore it? Or log it? Or throw? Up to you.
 * }
 * // From this point on, `maybeTravelAgency` will have type `TravelAgency`
 * const travelAgency = maybeTravelAgency;
 * ```
